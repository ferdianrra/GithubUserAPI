GitHub User App - Android Application for Displaying GitHub Profile Lists Using GitHub API

This is one of the projects I completed for the final assignment of the Dicoding module "Fundamental Android" at Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka. The application displays a list of GitHub user accounts using the GitHub API.

The application has several features, including displaying a list of GitHub users on the home page, searching for users by username, viewing detailed information for each user on a detail page, bookmarking favorite users to view a list of favorite users in offline mode, and changing the theme directly within the app.

This application is built using several components, including the Retrofit library to fetch data displayed in a RecyclerView, a SearchBar and SearchView for searching users by username, a TabLayout and ViewPager to display the list of followers and following for each user on the same page, the Room Database to store favorite users, and Datastore to save theme settings.
